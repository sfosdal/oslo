# Oslo

### Overview
Oslo is a tiny library of small but hopefully useful things.

### Why would I do this?
* I've had to write these over and over again, I want to stop repeating myself.
* So that others may benefit from shared effort
* So that others may lend their efforts to sharing.

### What's with the name?
* I'm lazy, Oslo has only four letters.
* I'm lazy, Oslo is easy pronounce. If you disagree, see [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0d/Oslo.ogg "Wikipedia").
* I've visted Oslo once, it was nice. I recommend it. Go see [this](http://www.khm.uio.no/ "Kulturhistorisk museum").
* Oh, also, my ancestors were from Norway, but really it's mostly because I'm lazy and like traveling.
